        <h2>Nintendo Wii</h2>
        <p>The Wii is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19, 2006. As a seventh-generation console, the Wii competed with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. Nintendo states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of the two others. As of the first quarter of 2012, the Wii leads its generation over PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales, with more than 101 million units sold; in December 2009, the console broke the sales record for a single month in the United States.

        <p>The Wii introduced the Wii Remote controller, which can be used as a handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions. Another notable feature of the console is the now defunct WiiConnect24, which enabled it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode. Like other seventh-generation consoles, it features a game download service, called "Virtual Console", which features emulated games from past systems.</p>

                      <h3> Nintendo Switch </h3>

                          <p>The Nintendo Switch, known in development as the NX, is an upcoming hybrid video game console developed by Nintendo, and the company's seventh major home console. Officially unveiled in October 2016, it is currently scheduled for release worldwide in March 2017</p>

                          <p>The Switch's main unit is shaped like a tablet, featuring two detachable controllers on either side called Joy-Cons, which can be used individually or attached to a grip to provide a traditional gamepad form. The main unit is connected to a television display through a docking station, from which it can be removed and used as a portable console. Despite this characteristic, Nintendo markets the Switch primarily as a home console rather than as a portable. The Switch uses flash ROM cartridges rather than optical discs, similar to the Nintendo 3DS.</p>
