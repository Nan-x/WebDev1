        <h1> Nintendo DS </h1>
         <p>The Nintendo DS is a 32-bit dual-screen handheld game console developed and released by Nintendo. The device went on sale in North America on November 21, 2004. The DS, short for "Developers' System" or "Dual Screen", introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming: two LCD screens working in tandem (the bottom one featuring a touchscreen), a built-in microphone, and support for wireless connectivity.[5] Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network. Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-closed Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. Its main competitor was Sony's PlayStation Portable as part of the seventh generation era.</p>

        <p>Prior to its release, the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental, "third pillar" in Nintendo's console lineup, meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. However, backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series.[6] On March 2, 2006, Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite, a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens. On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi, another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features. All Nintendo DS models combined have sold 154.02 million units,[7] making it the best selling handheld game console to date, and the second best selling video game console of all time.[1][8] The Nintendo DS line was succeeded by the Nintendo 3DS line in 2011.</p>

                      <h3> Nintendo Switch </h3>
                          <img id="new" src="images/nintendoswitch.jpg" alt="Nintendo Switch">
                          <p>The Nintendo Switch, known in development as the NX, is an upcoming hybrid video game console developed by Nintendo, and the company's seventh major home console. Officially unveiled in October 2016, it is currently scheduled for release worldwide in March 2017</p>

                          <p>The Switch's main unit is shaped like a tablet, featuring two detachable controllers on either side called Joy-Cons, which can be used individually or attached to a grip to provide a traditional gamepad form. The main unit is connected to a television display through a docking station, from which it can be removed and used as a portable console. Despite this characteristic, Nintendo markets the Switch primarily as a home console rather than as a portable. The Switch uses flash ROM cartridges rather than optical discs, similar to the Nintendo 3DS.</p>
