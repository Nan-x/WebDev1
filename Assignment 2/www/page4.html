            <p> Animal Crossing is a community simulation video game series developed and published by Nintendo, in which the human player lives in a village inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, carrying out various activities including fishing, bug catching, fossil hunting, etc. The series is notable for its open-ended gameplay and extensive use of the game systems' internal clock and calendar to simulate real passage of time. Four Animal Crossing games have been released worldwide, one each for the GameCube (Originally Nintendo 64), Nintendo DS, Wii, and the Nintendo 3DS. The series has been both critically and commercially successful and has sold over 27 million units worldwide. Two new spin-off games, Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer and Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival, were released for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U respectively in 2015. And Animal Crossing New Leaf Welcome Amiibo was released for Nintendo 3DS in 2016</p>

                          <p>The Nintendo Switch, known in development as the NX, is an upcoming hybrid video game console developed by Nintendo, and the company's seventh major home console. Officially unveiled in October 2016, it is currently scheduled for release worldwide in March 2017</p>

                          <p>The Switch's main unit is shaped like a tablet, featuring two detachable controllers on either side called Joy-Cons, which can be used individually or attached to a grip to provide a traditional gamepad form. The main unit is connected to a television display through a docking station, from which it can be removed and used as a portable console. Despite this characteristic, Nintendo markets the Switch primarily as a home console rather than as a portable. The Switch uses flash ROM cartridges rather than optical discs, similar to the Nintendo 3DS.</p>
